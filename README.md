# 🛡️ Lakshman Rekha — Senior Protection Against Scams & Fraud (Android)

Lakshman Rekha is an Android application designed to protect Indian senior citizens from phone-based scams, phishing messages, fake links, and social engineering fraud.  
The app acts as a real-time digital guardian, detecting, interrupting, and explaining scam attempts in simple language that seniors understand.

Inspired by real stories of Indian grandparents being targeted daily, Lakshman Rekha focuses on **prevention, interruption, and human-first guidance**, not just detection.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Indian seniors are frequently targeted by:
- Fake customer-care calls
- OTP theft scams
- KYC / bank account blocking messages
- WhatsApp forwards with malicious links
- Emotional manipulation (“relative in distress” scams)

The consequences include:
- Financial loss
- Emotional trauma
- Loss of trust in technology

Lakshman Rekha is built to **actively intervene**, not just warn.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> “If a senior doesn’t understand what’s happening, the app must step in and protect.”

Design priorities:
- Minimal interaction
- Loud, visible intervention
- Plain-language explanations
- Human fallback (family contact)
